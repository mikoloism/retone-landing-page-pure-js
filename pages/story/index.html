									From inception to creation, Retone has traversed a long road.
									Our intention was to draw attention to and portray the
									importance of a door&apos;s role in interior design. As such,
									doors should be considered a decorative and original part in
									this design aspect, rather than their oft seen role of filling
									the framework of our shelters. Retone&apos;s vision was to
									create doors with maximum endurance and strength in its
									perfection of beauty, elegance and harmony.
								</p>
								<p class="section__paragraph">
									A variety of choices was at our disposal to visualize those
									goals. Our catalyst, was interpreting the level of strength and
									durability that could be envisioned for the safety that our
									doors would furnish for Retone&apos;s clients.
								</p>
								<p class="section__paragraph">
									What was the summit that could be achieved beyond current,
									global, door safety? Our decision was to anchor our ideal at the
									eye of vision and bellow the ceiling on the existing level of
									endurance. Due to Retone&apos;s idealistic vortex, it was
									pertinent for Retone to give birth to a new brain child; a door
									that would be embellished with elite aesthetical values while
									remaining true to its purpose as a shield and protection against
									the intrusions of man and nature on our protective structural
									cocoon.

								<p class="section__paragraph">
									Typically, and conventionally, the relationship between a door’s
									durability and its aesthetics may appear insignificant. 
									However, Retone’s conceptualization and vision of a door,
									differs in this regard.  Retone has a holistic approach in its
									design and creation whereby, all a door’s elements amalgamate,
									allowing integral interrelation and definition. Our goal was
									designing a product where a sense of glory and endurance would
									be instilled into the end user and his community while
									reflecting subtle artistic values.  These ideals should not
									distract or detract from the goal of a door’s role in safety,
									nor from the end user’s peace of mind.  The time to return to
									the drafting table and innovate was at our proverbial door step.
									Our mission? To create the deepest, most accessible emotions of
									our audience with the simplest and most familiar game plan while
									passing through the “heart of nature”, the origin and abode of
									man. In addition to the sense of originality that nature
									imparts, natural surroundings also shout out: safe haven; a
									sentiment unfound in synthetics. It is not only ancient, but
									timeless.

									With our feet firmly grounded on mother earth’s ground, in a
									symbiosis with her, her enchantments and inspiration; our goals
									were crystal clear. Retone’s doors would achieve the highest
									standard of elegance lent to us by shaking mother earth’s hands
									with modern know how, resulting in captivating enchantment, and
									still achieving the goal of respecting and saving mother nature,
									for our future generations because our doors have been created
									with recycling and sustainability in mind. We have all your
									nature preservation concerns, covered.
								</p>
								<p class="section__paragraph">
									Armed with our polished considerations and intentions; what was
									to follow was an entourage of criteria that would naturally lead
									to a philosophy; a philosophy that was required to create
									Retone’s identity. This identity was shaping itself by
									reassessing and redefining the concept of a door, and had hit a
									distinct perspective, in sight of a fusion of scientific,
									artistic, philosophical, moral, and technological strands of
									creation. The ensuing approach articulated all our values, our
									vision as well as our policies in a coherent and systematic way
									and would lead us to the general atmosphere of all constituents
									of commissioning a project; from design to product line.

									Conceptualizing products’ blueprints where the hallmark of
									taste, blends seamlessly with a summit of functional ease, we
									assumed an obligation of facilitating maximum coordination
									between varying and multitudinous facets of product design. An
									Artist’s vision and intuition, natural material discernment and
									its refinement, product concept modeling as well as an
									engineer’s computations of product structure and form; all
									­­­called for the guidance and consensus of a host of masters in
									respective disciplines of art and industry.

									Our approach to product design called for an adherence to
									minimalist, aesthetic principles and the elimination of optical,
									excessiveness. Brand identity in addition, also called for
									golden ratios and grid structures as requisites of mathematical
									and geometrically precise design, depicting the modern era.

								<p class="section__paragraph">
									In product design, the potential for calibrating the correlation
									between aesthetics and human implementation, so that
									attractiveness of design follows function, must be given its due
									consideration. All human comforts derived from allowance of
									relaxation, ergonomics, luxury and ease of serviceability were
									among the core components of our identity and high on the list
									of our tangible values, ascertaining further ease and
									familiarity. Our doors should yield all levels of end users the
									capacity to undergo commensurate sensual and subconscious
									transposition of the brush of a delicate breeze in a temperate
									forest.

									Besides this, a product line able to simultaneously converge the
									values from philosophy, art, science and technology while
									defining a brand identity was going to require a holistic and
									coherent vision whereby all phenomena submitting to a brand
									identity and essential values, interact in harmony. They are
									orchestrated in concert with each other, supporting and
									reforming one another as they march forward reflecting an
									agreement of values. Articulation of this coherence and
									coordination was the thread that determined the success of the
									output product line design.

									The basic values of the brand were instrumental in creating the

								<p class="section__paragraph">
									The construction of the special production line of these doors
									was a function of the basic values of the brand. In this line of
									production, human beings are considered as an innovative element
									that meets the creative aspects of the production of the work.
									Heavy parts are transported in the production line by making
									carrier ligaments.
								</p>
								<p class="section__paragraph">
									Ensuing human creativity, technology was the cardinal element of
									our product line. Merging the fluidity and expressiveness of
									human creativity with the precision of artificial intelligence
									would enable the creation of the quintessential artistic
									invention; original and fluid in its artistic expression and
									visionary. We built our industrial platform in line with fourth
									generation technology approaches making, the components of the
									production line optimally designed by artificial intelligence
									for the optimum and most efficient use of resources,
									acknowledging the limitations of human mind. Data is recorded
									continuously and accurately, in each component of the process,
									resulting in an incremental, and continual, increase of
									learning. Also, most of the intelligent transferal and
									communication between the different robots of this production
									line should have taken place. Our rationale for selecting the
									most advanced technology in our production line, allowing the
									best to cover our brand identity, creating a transcendent
									product; efficient and estimable.
