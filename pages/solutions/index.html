						</header>

						<p class="section__paragraph">
							Retone has facilitated the following solutions to elevate the integrity
							of anti-theft doors: 1. The incorporation of steel bars and multiple
							metal rods of various metals which intertwine into a grid form. This
							grid is integrated into the Hero door&apos;s body. It provides an
							elaborate structural defense against intrusion and penetration.
							Although, this additional implementation results in a weightier product,
							it does not impede the transportation or installation procedures of the
							product. The proprietary solution of Retone takes into consideration and
							allowance, the disassembly of the door and its various peripheral and
							inclusive elements.
						</p>
						<p class="section__paragraph">
							2. The facilitation of exceptional nanocomposite material in
							Retone&apos;s proprietary invention, provides various properties which
							elevate a door&apos;s integrity. The front and rear of the double-sided
							door are integrated with each other to absorb multiple, potentially
							destructive shocks which are then distributed evenly through the Hero
							Retone body. This shock force is then transmitted to the Hero Retone
							frame section and transmitted to the reinforced concrete behind it.

							<h2 class="section__title">Preservation of Natural Resources</h2>
						</header>

						<p class="section__paragraph">
							Retone Hero uses wood and other natural material in order to deliver the
							sense and appearance of nature in the products' aesthetics; conveying a
							sense of peace in man's surroundings, which only nature can deliver. How
							can the least amount of natural resources be harvested while still
							producing doors that allow man to benefit from nature's bounties? Man's
							propensity towards the utilization of wood in various home or office
							decor applications is causing the depletion of this valuable, natural
							resource and its benefits, available to man. This need is best satisfied
							by industrial tree planting as opposed to tree cutting of existing trees
							which only further endangers the earth's depreciating forests. This can
							save the earth from further damage as well as soil erosion in the most
							effective way. The goal is to continue to satisfy man's inclination
							towards nature's grounding and healing properties, found in wood and the
							mineral kingdom, by bringing them into his interior design; while
							simultaneously protecting the earth's precious and diminishing natural
							resources. Retone resists the cutting of trees indiscriminately by
							inventing new materials and provides optimal facilitation of wood.

							<h2 class="section__title">Upgrading the Potentials of Door Design</h2>
						</header>

						<p class="section__paragraph">
							In the process of manufacturing doors, we sometimes come across
							propositions from designers concerning the facilitation of upgrades in
							door casing materials. The use of such upgraded materials may require
							rudimentary adjustments. For example, the use of stone in the door
							casing causes a significant increase in the door&apos;s weight, which
							creates new challenges in the door&apos;s structural aspects. Retone has
							created a sequence of high-tech resolutions to allow the diversification
							of materials in the door&apos;s visage, increasing the speed and scale
							of the manufacturing process of doors and integrated elements.

								Retone Hero: From Production Site, to End User
							</h2>
						</header>

						<p class="section__paragraph">
							Conventional doors are usually obtained from a store or production
							facility. The client is characteristically responsible for
							transportation and installation while suppliers are not liable for any
							damages incurred along the way nor during installation. On the contrary,
							circumstances may arise where the product and installation slot have
							size discrepancies; in which case, changes are necessarily made to the
							installation slot. Retone has devised solutions for both predicaments.
							Retone takes on responsibility for every supply end phase of the
							process; from production facility, to use of door by the end user. In
							addition, before installation of the sub frame, Retone monitoring
							experts interact with the contractor and match the sub frames to the
							standard door size.
